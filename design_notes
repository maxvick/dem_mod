Sun 28 Oct:
progress:
   - have created table structure for gen data in psql
   - have got pandas loaded in py3
   - have determined that I will keep data in pandas DataFrames for now
   - have notes in one of the python files for how to loop, need a loop for finishing interstate balancing
   
to do:
   - create dummy datatables to test the program
   - need to determine the tests I want to run, i.e. what to check for:
      * ability to check input and flag errors if input incorrect
      * test scenario with pre-determined outputs to check if a scenario works
      * following that I should have other ideas to make it more general
